What is it?

A tool that looks up words on the web. 

Specifically speaking, it gets data for a word or phrase from wikipedia/wiktionary (if available). If definition is not available then wikipedia's summary of the phrase/word is retrieved and displayed.

Also supports food. Try typing in food like "Big Mac" or "Chicken McNuggets". Data is scraped and parsed from wikipedia's generated html and is then displayed in the application. 

The application is coded in complete MVC style. You will find the view, model, and controller in their seperate folders


How to use it?

Run LookUp.jar

Simply select a phrase or word in the application by clicking-dragging over the word/phrase. The application will the perform a look up. Info boxes are closed by pressing any key or by clicking the close button on the corner.
